# bachelor-study-highlight

My machine learning journey starts with Genetic Algorithm. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/AzureStream/first-genetic-alogrithm).
After that, my study of machine learning continued on multiple topics. This repository contains some projects that highlights my journey.

### Tugas Besar Machine Learning
This project brought me towards clustering for the first time. I used K-Means algorithm. The notebook explains the steps of implementing the algorithm, starting with data exploration and preprocessing. It is wraped up with visualization of the clusters.

### klasifikasi_2
This project is the continuation of the previous one. The main takeaways here are the usage of Scikit Learn and grid search to produce the best model.

### Submission_Proyek_Akhir
This is a submission as a requirement to complete a course from [dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com/). In this project, I use tensorflow to classify hand gestures into three classes: rock, paper, scissor.

### Tubes aml
Auto ML is featured in this project. Additionally, I compare the time it took to produce a model using dataset preprocessed with PCA and without.
